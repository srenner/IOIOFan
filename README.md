IOIOFan
=======

IOIOFan is the first step to building PitMonitor, the Android powered BBQ smoker controller. Functionality of this and other IOIO based apps will eventually be merged into the main PitMonitor application, but for now, any code that works as standalone functionality will be placed in a separate app.
